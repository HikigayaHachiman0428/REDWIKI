# Welcome to Red Wiki
Welcome, comrade!

Welcome to Red Wiki, a website that aims for familiarizing, transmitting, and sharing Marxist perspectives.

The establishers of this website are shocked and indignant to see many unfairness and unjustness that exist in the modern world, and they avidly aspire to express, via their own voices, opinions or analyses of societal phenomena and an eager call for a change. Being nurtured by Marxism, having a strong desire to obtain a platform that allows individuals to share their own standpoints, and suffering the anguish of lacking a complete Marxist dictionary, we have established this website, and we hope to feel at ease here to shout out our viewpoints and our dreams for a more ideal world. 

Right, these are the purposes and tenets for Red Wiki to exist: Ideal and opinions. We are always glad to greet anyone who has grander ideals for this imperfect world and who wants to express his or her views in delighting freedom.
