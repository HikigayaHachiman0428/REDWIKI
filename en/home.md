# Welcome to Red Wiki
Welcome, comrade!

Welcome to Red Wiki, a website established to familiarize, transmit, and share Marxist perspectives among the collective.

The establishers of this website are shocked and indignant to see many unfairness and unjustness of the modern society, and they aspire to, via their own voices, express what they think about various societal phenomena and their eagerness for a change to take place. Nurtured by Marxism, suffered from the lack of a complete Marxist dictionary, we have established this website under a hope to share personal views freely, and we are avid to shout out our viewpoints and a wish for a more ideal world.

These are, as a result, the purposes and tenets of Red Wiki's existance: Ideal and aspiration. We will always welcome anyone who believes that the current world is not yet perfect, and anyone who holds a higher ideal expectation for the world we all live in and manage with. We are, furthermore, avid to see people who open with themselves and speak what they want here, with delighting freedom that is precious to produce an output of their ideal world with approaching perfection. None of any political power should have the privileges to hinder the path of people who want to study or make progress: openness and democracy are what needed for a Marxist forum, and they are also the invincible gists and firm stands that this website holds.
